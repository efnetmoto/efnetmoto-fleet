# Docker Compose Override Example
# 
# Copy this file to docker-compose.override.yml to customize your deployment
# without modifying the main docker-compose.yml file.
#
# Docker Compose automatically merges docker-compose.override.yml with
# docker-compose.yml when you run docker-compose commands.

# Example 1: Mount additional volumes
# services:
#   decisis:
#     volumes:
#       - /path/to/custom/scripts:/home/eggdrop/eggdrop/scripts-extra:ro
