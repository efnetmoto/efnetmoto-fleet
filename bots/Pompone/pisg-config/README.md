# PISG Configuration Directory

This directory contains configuration files for the pisg IRC statistics generator.

## Configuration Files

### Generated by Ansible

- `pisg.cfg` - Main pisg configuration (generated from template)

### Static Files (committed to repo)

- `user.cfg` - User aliases and mappings
- `spam.cfg` - Links and users to ignore
- `footer.txt` - Page footer text for generated HTML

## File Descriptions

### pisg.cfg

The main configuration file that defines:

- Channel to process
- Log locations and format
- Output file paths
- Time zone settings
- Word filters (profanity and violence)

This file is generated from `templates/pisg.cfg.j2` by Ansible using variables from `ansible/host_vars/localhost/pompone.yml`.

### user.cfg

Maps IRC nick aliases to canonical nicknames for consistent statistics. For example:

```text
<user nick="tedski" alias="tedski-">
```

This ensures "tedski" and "tedski-" are counted as the same user.

### spam.cfg

Defines links and users to ignore in statistics generation:

```text
<link url="http://spam.example.com" ignore="y">
<user nick="spambot" ignore="y">
```

### footer.txt

Plain text footer appended to generated HTML pages. Can include contact info, disclaimers, etc.

## Important Notes

- `pisg.cfg` is gitignored (generated file)
- Static config files (user.cfg, spam.cfg, footer.txt) should be committed to the repo
- All files are mounted read-only into the pisg container
