# nginx Service

Custom nginx container based on `nginx:alpine` with UID adjusted to match other bot services.

## Purpose

Serves static HTML content generated by PISG statistics generator. The container runs with UID 100 to match the eggdrop and pisg containers, allowing proper file access permissions.

## UID/GID Configuration

- **UID**: 100 (modified from upstream's 101)
- **GID**: nginx group (inherited from base image)

This ensures nginx can read HTML files generated by pisg without permission issues.

## Implementation

Uses `usermod` from Alpine's `shadow` package to change the existing nginx user's UID to 100, then removes the shadow package to keep image size minimal. This approach:
- Preserves all upstream nginx user configuration
- Only modifies the UID that needs changing

## Usage in docker-compose.yml

```yaml
nginx:
  build:
    context: ../../services/nginx
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
  ports:
    - "${STATS_PORT}:80"
  volumes:
    - ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro
```

## Base Image

Uses official `nginx:alpine` as the base. All default nginx configuration, entrypoint, and command are inherited unchanged.

## Exposed Ports

- **80** - HTTP port for serving content (inherited from base image)
